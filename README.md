## Overview
This is the AWS info for any poor souls who find themselves in ITSCM 451. I did learn a lot in the class through working with my team, but it was a tremendous amount of work. </br>
</br>
This repository only includes files specifically for the hosting the website. Any lambda functions, databases, etc. have all been since deleted. For the assistance of future students, though, I've explained how our infrastructure was set up.</br>
* P.S As per the recommendation of the professor for this course much of the website and lambda functions have been AI generated by Claude.AI Pro. Given the time constraints and extremely limited lack of guidance it would not have been possible to do without AI assistance.
  * Regardless of this, though, I still learned much about many amazon tools and the ways in which they interact with eachother.
## Website
The static website was publicly hosted in an AWS S3 bucket. It would update from this GitHub Repo using a GitHub action that would upload the files in this repository to the S3 bucket using an AWS access key for an IAM profile each time there was a commit.
## User Information Database
User and Order information was saved in a mySQL database hosted on Amazon RDS. This had two tables, one for customer information (customer ID [primary/foreign key], email, address, etc) and another for order information (order id, products ordered, product info [color, size, etc], customer who ordered them) </br>
</br>
Users couldn't log in but their orders were saved when placed. This was done through an API gateway that would trigger lambda functions to send the information to the mySQL database.
## Inventory Database
This was probably the easiest part to set up. The inventory was managed through a DynamoDB database. When placing orders on the website, it would check if the item was in stock and if so then allow you to check out. The database was just one table with different fields (ex. iPhone128gb, Pixel64gb, etc.) that all had different values for the amount of fake "inventory" that was available. Like almost everything in this project it was updated and connected to the website using an API gateway with lambda functions. 
## Notification System
Working on this wasn't my role in the project so I'm a bit less knowledgeable about this topic. When users placed their orders, it would trigger (probably thru a lambda function) an email to be sent using Amazon SES to the persons email confirming their order, order ID, products bought, address, etc. 
## IAM roles
Again, something I didn't work with much so I may be wrong, but here is my interpretation. Any IAM roles were primarily set up just to allow group members and other AWS tools to function properly. For example a DynamoDB role was made and assigned to allow different tools such as lambda functions to edit the DynamoDB database. 
## Other things to note:
This was all done and deleted about 6 months before I typed this ReadME documentation, so I can't remember every detail of what we did. I would need to use the AWS console again and work through problems in order to remember things to document. </br>
Here's our reference architecture if it means anything. We used Eraser.io for making our initial prototype which worked flawlessly.
